   <p class="parrafo-1">Touching is a basic physical and emotional need for babies. It is a fundamental factor for their affective and emotional security, although the benefits of physical contact affect all areas: motor, cognitive and psychological. Physical contact is the best way to facilitate a secure attachment, which in our species is adaptive in nature, since it has allowed us to survive during the evolution of the humanity. There are numerous studies that have shown that an inappropriate link predisposes to suffer personality disturbances and even mental disorders. "Attachment is so important that it influences the organization of the limbic system, key in the management of emotions, learning and adaptability. The Touch Research Institute, in which different American universities collaborate, has attested among the positive effects: </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Reduction of apnea and sudden death syndrome</li>
   <li>Weight gain in premature babies</li>
   <li>Better resistance to disease</li>
   <li>As well as a stimulation of the immune system</li>
   <li>And more balanced moods, by reducing stress.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="subtitulo-1">Kangaroo mother care, which consists of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding on her part:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Improves thermoregulation </li>
    <li> Improves metabolic adaptation </li>
    <li> And it reduces infections.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Subtitle-II -->
    
  <p class="subtitulo-2">In 2015 a publication in the journal Pediatrics showed conclusive data:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>Skin-to-skin contact reduces the probability of death by 36% </li>
   <li> And it reduces the risk of infection by 47% in babies weighing less than 2 kg. </li>
  </ul>

 <br><br>
    
 <p>Likewise, in 2017, another study on premature and full-term babies concluded that physical contact has effect on the brain of the newborn and its perceptual, cognitive and social development in the future. So how important is physical contact for the baby. </p>

 <h3 class="investigaciones">Does the physical contact that the human being receives in the first years of life have some kind of relationship with that violent societies exist?</h3>

 <p> Although it may seem exaggerated, the truth is that there is an association between physical contact and violence. The study by neuropsychologist James Prescott, who was director of the National Institute of Health and Development Childhood of the USA, based on 49 tribes that he researched for years, showed that there was a direct relationship between the degree of physical contact and the level of violence in human groups. He discovered that societies that showed little physical contact and little affection towards their children, develop a higher degree of violence in adulthood.</p> 
 <p>The first year of life babies need, due to their great vulnerability, as a result of being born prematurely and immature, a lot of physical contact for proper development. It has been corroborated, from different sciences (neurobiology, anthropology, neuropediatrics or perinatal neurology) the need for a period of exterogestation, lasting 9 to 12 months, time in which the baby must have the most conditions similar possible to its stage in utero. The reason is the extreme dependence of the human baby who, when to be born prematurely, without having completed its development, must culminate it after birth. The reasons are physiological, the consequences of the standing process and the great brain development in our species.</p>

<h3 class="anna">The importance of positive affectivity and the story of Anna's children</h3>
        
 <p>In 1915 a famous New York pediatrician, Henri Chapin, produced a catastrophic report that spoke of the high mortality rate of children admitted to orphanages: barely surviving those who managed to reception outside the institutions.</p>

 <p>Dr. Fritz Talbot, a Boston pediatrician, then began an exhaustive investigation into the mysterious marasmus <em> (type of malnutrition due to energy deficiency, resulting in a total caloric deficit).</em> He toured countless orphanages in various countries of the world finding that mortality was in the same levels. The revelation came when visiting a hospice in Dusseldorf (Germany) before the first war: in that place the children seemed healthier and stronger and yet received the same attention than children hospitalized in other centers. During your visit to the rooms with the director of the center observed an elderly woman carrying a baby on her hip. Talbot asked the medical director who was this woman. <em>“Oh, that's old Anna. When we've done everything we can since medical point of view for a child, and still not well, we give it to old Anna. She always succeeds. ”</em> Miracle! The children Anna carried survived.</p>

<h3 class="teachers">Body care for teachers</h3>

  <p>In the kindergarten, it is essential that the teachers, who constantly put the body with the children, take the necessary precautions to have a healthy physique. In addition to having a good eating habit and rest, it is also necessary to exercise and move the body to give strength to the muscles of the spine so that they can then keep it on its axis and achieve a good body posture.</p>

 <p>Having good posture not only helps the body to move more easily but also to level psychic and mental helps us to keep our eyes ahead, re-educating the body and the mind to have new prospects. I mention this because it is very likely that a person who does not have good posture will tend to draw your gaze downward due to the very fatigue of the muscles surrounding the spine vertebral, the body seeks to compensate for that fatigue and causes other muscles of the body to strain, it is say, do force, in compensation of those who are tired and in tension, since for lack of exercise were losing enough strength to keep the spine erect. As soon as that natural compensation that the body makes to be able to keep its eyes always on the horizon line (the which prevents us from looking at things crookedly when the spine is not erect), the muscles that are compensating, due to the double effort made by those muscles that are fatigued, these begin to contract also due to the constant excess tension that accumulates in they. It is very important to observe what our body tells us and to keep it moving in a healthy way.</p>

 <p>Returning to posture accommodation as a technique, it is generally used before starting to perform the different postures in a yoga class, because it prepares us to be able to perform in a adequate the class itself. The goal of the exercise is to straighten and stretch the spine with a series techniques, these exercises are often aimed at working with the feet and supporting the themselves on the floor. Even starting a yoga class accommodating the posture allows us to initiate the students in the concentration and awareness of their own bodies, together with the observation of the breathing that opens the doors to tranquility and to being present in the here and now. </p>

 <p> As we can see, the accommodation of the posture not only helps us to have the spine in axis, making the physical body feel healthier but also and at the same time we are developing and stimulating mental concentration, which allows us to be more aware of the present. <em> "Mental concentration is a psychic process that is carried out through reasoning; consists in voluntarily focus the full attention of the mind on a goal, object or activity that is being doing or thinking of doing at that time, leaving aside the whole series of facts or other objects that may be able to interfere with their achievement or their attention. Concentration is vital for study and work. "</em> The exercise lasts approximately ten minutes, causes the person begins to have greater awareness of their own body, managing to make present and feel areas that perhaps before they went more unnoticed. This practice acquired as a daily habit, in addition to stimulating concentration, generates a better posture of the spine, and develops greater body awareness, helping us to re-educate the body and we can also better control our emotions.</p>

 <p>The concept of the control and observation of the breath which is another tool of yoga called in the Sanskrit word “Pranayama”, it literally means “breath control” <em> (prāṇá: air, breath, life, inspired air, vital force; iāma: control). </em> It is one of the techniques fundamental that enables us to connect with ourselves, achieving through it produce different effects on the body. Among the most used and outstanding exercises are those that invite us to enter a state of relaxation, self-control and concentration. <em> (Since they exist many types of pranayamas, which can also balance us or invite us to have a greater energy in the body, among other possible effects).</em></p>

 <p> Finally, whoever is interested in this type of practices and techniques and wants to investigate more on the subject, I recommend as a first general approach the book "The complete book of yoga" by James Hewitt, in which he explains in a simple way some concepts of this discipline.</p>

 <h3 class="experiential-experiences">Experiential Experiences</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>Experience I: Right spine, greater general mobility of the body. </li>
   <li> Experience II: Body awareness through breathing. </li>
   <li> Experience III: To accommodate the posture, as we mentioned before, you have to work the soles. There are different ways to do it, which we will all do together in the exercise practical will be simply through breathing and concentration, with the feet resting on the Floor with or without stockings (as each one prefers) on a flat and hard surface such as the floor.</li>
   <li> Experiment IV: Work with the feet through contact with the hands. </li>
   <li> Experience V: Alternatives to footwork with elements: tennis ball, rubber roller foam, cork.</li>
  </ul>
